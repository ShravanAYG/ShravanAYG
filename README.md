## About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast working at the intersection of **embedded systems, machine learning, and real-world data**.  
I enjoy building things that run close to the hardware from **STM32 and ESP32 firmware** to **TinyML models deployed on microcontrollers**.

- Working with **ESP32, STM32, Arduino, ESP-IDF**
- Building ML models using **satellite IR imagery for rainfall prediction**
- Interested in **systems programming, toolchains, and low-level debugging**
- Love learning about **space, satellite orbital dynamics, and physics**
